The Bus Ticket Booking System is a web-based project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It provides an easy-to-use interface for booking bus tickets online. Users can fill in their journey details through a form, and the booking information is displayed on a confirmation page using JavaScript localStorage.
